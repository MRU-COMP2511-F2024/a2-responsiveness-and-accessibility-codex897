# Web Accessibility
Web accessibility refers to designing websites with features and components that are inclusive to individuals who may not have the physical or sensory abilities to engage with the average website effectively. This includes considerations for people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities, ensuring they can access and navigate online content as easily as possible. Accessibility is not just about meeting legal requirements or following standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG); it’s about creating an inclusive online environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to interact with digital content.

Issues Identified: 
-Image alt tags were not descriptive enough to allow a vision impaired person to understand what was displayed. Similarly, there was no caption in our table initially.
-format needed adjustments to make things more consistent with usual website design, and easier to navigate
-we didnt have any functionalities to let people navigating through focus to skip our nav links. Additionally, some functions of our website are not as obvious as they should be. 

Changes:
improved descriptiveness on captions and alt tags, adjusted format to conform to common website design. Adding navigation functionalities, and css stylings to communicate where inputs/ buttons are.

Connection to Gesalt Principles:


### Colors and Accessibility
One specific area of web accessibility is color design. For instance, a significant portion of the male population experiences some form of color blindness, such as red-green color blindness (the most common type). This means they may struggle to differentiate between certain colors, particularly when similar hues are used together. To make websites more accessible, designers can choose color schemes and contrasts that are easier for colorblind users to perceive.

For example, blue is considered a relatively safe and neutral color for most types of color blindness. This is one reason why many companies, such as Facebook, use blue hues in their logos and website color schemes. Blue not only appeals to a wide audience but also ensures better visibility and clarity for those with color vision deficiencies. However, simply choosing certain colors isn’t enough—designers must also consider contrast ratios to ensure text is readable against its background. Tools like color contrast checkers can help verify that the combination of text and background colors meets accessibility standards.
